In order to see the results of all four tasks, please make sure the relative positions of folders are not changed after unzipping the files.

******************************************************************************
The following information is about the structures of all the files.               

CommonFunctions - All the MATLAB functions used in the four tasks
doc - The report of the Part-A                                                                
Images - The three images used in Task 1, Task2, and Task 3
Results - All the result images in the report
Task_1_2 - The script of Task 1 and Task 2
Task_3 - The script of Task 3
Task_4 - The script and data files of Task 4
******************************************************************************

By runing the scripts in the folder Task_1_2, Task_3, and Task_4, all the result images can be got.
When running the script of Task 1, 2 and 3, please note that the scripts are paused at each step of the simulation and the result images of this step will be shown. 
The result images may be overlapped on the screen, please drag the images on the top to see the images under it.
When you see the following information in the command window of MATLAB
"Program paused. Press enter to continue.",
you can press the enter in the command window to continue to the next step.
